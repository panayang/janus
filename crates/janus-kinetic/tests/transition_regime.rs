//! Transition-regime (Kn ~ 1) validation: Couette-like shear flow between
//! two diffuse walls, but with a mean free path comparable to the domain
//! height (achieved via a low density / large `mu_ref`, i.e. large Kn),
//! run through the combined `UgkwpSolver` (wave + particle UGKWP coupling).
//!
//! This is a *qualitative* trend check (per the milestone instructions: "no
//! NaN/blowup, expected slip-flow characteristics"), not a tight quantitative
//! comparison against a specific published dataset — DESIGN: the spec asks
//! for "sane qualitative behavior... vs a reference or expected trend from
//! literature" and explicitly offers a flat-plate/lid-driven-cavity choice;
//! we use the Couette geometry (already has full BC infrastructure in M1/M2)
//! since it is the simpler of the two options the spec allows.
//!
//! Expected trend at Kn ~ 1 (transition/near-free-molecular regime), per the
//! classical rarefied-gas-dynamics literature (e.g. Bird, "Molecular Gas
//! Dynamics and the Direct Simulation of Gas Flows", 1994, ch. on Couette
//! flow at finite Kn; Sharipov & Seleznev's Couette-flow tabulations):
//! - The bulk velocity profile becomes *flatter* than the continuum linear
//!   profile (viscous shear layer thickens / momentum diffuses across the
//!   whole gap almost uniformly at high Kn).
//! - A finite velocity **slip** appears at the walls: the gas velocity at
//!   the wall-adjacent cell does NOT equal the wall velocity (no-slip is a
//!   continuum-only assumption); the slip velocity should be an
//!   appreciable fraction of the wall speed once Kn is O(1).
//! - No NaN/Inf anywhere, and the solution remains bounded (no blowup).
