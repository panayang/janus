// Test 8 (conservation-under-load-balancing / block decomposition) lives in
// `janus-sched`'s own test suite (`crates/janus-sched/tests/
// conservation_under_decomposition.rs`), not here: `janus-sched` depends on
// `janus-kinetic` (ENGINEERING_SPEC.md §3's one-directional crate-dependency
// rule), so exercising `janus_sched::block::partition_grid` from a
// `janus-kinetic` test would require a `janus-kinetic -> janus-sched`
// dev-dependency, creating an actual Cargo dependency cycle between the two
// crates (dev-dependency cycles between workspace members are fragile and
// contrary to the spirit of the one-directional dependency rule even where
// Cargo might tolerate them). Placing the test in `janus-sched` (which
// already legitimately depends on both `janus-core` and `janus-kinetic`)
// avoids the cycle while testing the exact same property.
