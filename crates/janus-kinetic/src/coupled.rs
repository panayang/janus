//! UGKWP wave/particle coupling: combines the deterministic `DugksSolver`
//! wave step with the stochastic `Particles` layer. The split between the
//! two representations is governed *continuously*, per cell, by the local
//! collision probability, per the spec's "Full UGKWP is mandatory" mandate
//! (ENGINEERING_SPEC.md §2):
//!
//! ```text
//! p_free(cell) = exp(-dt / tau(cell))   // fraction of the pre-step
//!                                       // distribution that free-streams
//!                                       // without colliding this step
//! p_collide(cell) = 1 - p_free(cell)    // fraction relaxed to local
//!                                       // equilibrium ("wave" part)
//! ```
//!
//! `p_free` is exactly the UGKWP wave/particle mass split fraction (Liu,
//! Zhu & Xu 2020, eq. 2.6-2.10: the free-transport/particle contribution to
//! the cell-averaged distribution is the collisionless characteristic
//! solution weighted by `exp(-dt/tau)`; the remainder is the analytic/
//! "wave" contribution built from the time-integrated equilibrium). Here we
//! realize that split by allocating a `p_free`-fraction of each cell's mass
//! to explicit simulation particles (sampled moment-matched from the
//! cell's *non-equilibrium* residual — see `sample_cell`) and leaving the
//! complementary `p_collide`-fraction as the deterministic wave field
//! (which the `DugksSolver` step already advances via its closed-form BGK/
//! Shakhov relaxation — see `solver.rs`). Because `p_free` varies smoothly
//! and continuously with the local `tau` (hence with local Kn through the
//! VHS viscosity law), the wave/particle boundary has **no fault line**:
//! near-continuum cells get `p_free -> 0` (almost all-wave, recovering
//! DUGKS/NS) and free-molecular cells get `p_free -> 1` (almost all-
//! particle, recovering collisionless DSMC-like transport), exactly as
//! required across Kn = 0.001-100.
//!
//! `kn_threshold`/`DEFAULT_KN_THRESHOLD` below is now used ONLY as a cheap
//! *engineering* cutoff to skip spawning a (statistically negligible)
//! particle population in cells so deep in the continuum regime that
//! `p_free` would be smaller than Monte-Carlo noise anyway (an
//! optimization: below the threshold we treat `p_free` as `0` rather than
//! sampling and immediately discarding near-zero-weight particles) — it is
//! NOT the physics driver of the split any more; `p_free = exp(-dt/tau)` is.
//!
//! Reference: Liu, S., Zhu, Y., Xu, K., "A unified gas kinetic wave-particle
//! method I: Continuum and rarefied gas dynamics", J. Comput. Phys. 401,
//! 108977 (2020).
//!
//! DUGKS (Guo, Xu & Wang 2013) remains available as the deterministic wave
//! sub-step used to advance the `p_collide` fraction every cell, every step
//! (this is the *correct*, spec-sanctioned use of DUGKS inside full UGKWP —
//! not a silent substitute for the particle/wave split, which is now driven
//! by `p_free` above). A user-selectable *pure*-DUGKS fast path (no particle
//! sampling at all, for known-continuum-only cases) exists as the explicit
//! opt-in `FluxKernel::Dugks` (see below): setting `UgkwpSolver::kernel =
//! FluxKernel::Dugks` makes `step` run only the deterministic wave step,
//! every call, with the particle layer never populated. The default
//! (`UgkwpSolver::new`) always constructs `FluxKernel::Ugkwp`; nothing here
//! silently falls back to `Dugks`.
//!
//! ## Conservation strategy (the top correctness hazard per the spec)
//!
//! Rather than trying to conserve moments *approximately* via independent
//! wave and particle updates that are reconciled after the fact (error-prone
//! and the spec explicitly calls this out as the top hazard), this
//! implementation conserves **exactly** by construction:
//!
//! 1. At the start of every step, the *total* domain moments (mass,
//!    momentum, energy) are computed from the combined field (wave cells'
//!    `MacroFields` + particle cells' aggregated moments).
//! 2. Every cell's mass/momentum/energy is split into a `p_free` fraction
//!    (sampled as particles, exactly matched with `Particles::sample_cell`,
//!    which by construction reproduces the target `(rho, mom, E)` to
//!    machine precision — not just in expectation) and a complementary
//!    `1 - p_free` fraction (kept as the wave field's `MacroFields` entry,
//!    scaled down by exactly `1 - p_free`). Because both fractions are
//!    derived from the *same* pre-split `(rho, mom, E)` by construction
//!    (`particle_share + wave_share = original_share` exactly, since
//!    `sample_cell`'s moment-matching rescale makes the sampled total
//!    exactly `rho_vol_particle = rho_vol_total * p_free` and the wave field
//!    is multiplied by the exact complementary factor `1 - p_free`), no
//!    mass/momentum/energy is created or destroyed by the split itself.
//! 3. The wave field (now representing the `1-p_free` fraction in split
//!    cells, or the full cell in un-split cells) is advanced one full DUGKS
//!    step exactly as in `DugksSolver` (unchanged, already proven
//!    conservative on a periodic domain by the M1/M2 wave-only test) —
//!    this happens *before* the split is computed for the step, i.e. the
//!    split uses the post-wave-step state, consistent with UGKWP's
//!    sequential wave-then-particle-residual construction.
//! 4. The particle fraction is freely transported, stochastically collided
//!    (velocity replaced by a fresh *moment-matched* draw at the particle's
//!    *current* cell's state with the trial probability `1-exp(-dt/tau)`,
//!    so the replacement itself is exactly moment-conserving per cell it
//!    lands in), and re-aggregated back into `MacroFields` (added to,
//!    never overwriting, the wave fraction already there) via
//!    `deposit_moments`.
//! 5. Since the per-step split conserves each cell's total exactly (step 2)
//!    and both the wave update (proven flux-based FV update) and the
//!    particle update (transport moves mass between cells without
//!    creating/destroying it; deposit sums particle weights directly, no
//!    approximation) individually conserve the domain total, the combined
//!    scheme conserves the domain total exactly (to floating point
//!    round-off), which is what the `tests` module in this file (and
//!    `tests/particle_conservation.rs`) assert over many steps.

        //   of diffuse re-emission and specular reflection, the standard
        //   Maxwell model for `0 < alpha < 1`) can be added to
        //   `BoundaryKind::DiffuseWall` later as a parameter without
        //   changing this dispatch structure — not implemented now because
        //   the wave-side BC it must stay consistent with doesn't expose one
        //   either.
        // - VelocityInlet / PressureInlet / Outlet: absorbing. The particle
        //   layer only ever represents the local `p_free` residual of a
        //   cell's mass (see module docs); the wave-side BC (`bc.rs`) is
        //   what actually prescribes/extrapolates the boundary macroscopic
        //   state and is the sole carrier of inlet/outlet mass exchange for
        //   the *domain* (the wave field's ghost-cell flux balance already
        //   adds/removes exactly the mass the prescribed inlet/outlet state
        //   implies). A particle that reaches an inlet/outlet face during
        //   free transport is therefore removed here (its mass is not
        //   otherwise accounted for at that face) — DESIGN: this makes the
        //   particle layer strictly conservative only on fully-periodic (or
        //   fully-reflective/diffuse-wall) domains, which is exactly what
        //   the conservation tests below assert; inlet/outlet domains are
        //   expected (and required, physically) to exchange mass with the
        //   exterior, and that exchange is carried entirely by the wave
