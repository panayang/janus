//! UGKWP stochastic particle layer: SoA particle storage, free transport,
//! stochastic BGK/Shakhov collision, re-aggregation to cell moments, and the
//! wave/particle mass-momentum-energy exchange.
//!
//! Reference: Liu, S., Zhu, Y., Xu, K., "A unified gas kinetic wave-particle
//! method I: Continuum and rarefied gas dynamics", J. Comput. Phys. 401,
//! 108977 (2020).
//!
//! ## UGKWP split (per cell, per step)
//!
//! Each cell's distribution is split into a deterministic "wave" part and a
//! stochastic "particle" part according to the local collision-free fraction
//! `exp(-dt/tau)` (the fraction of the pre-step distribution that survives
//! one timestep without colliding, i.e. behaves like free-streaming
//! particles) versus `1 - exp(-dt/tau)` (the fraction that reaches local
//! equilibrium, handled deterministically as the "wave"/equilibrium part).
//! Cells with `kn_loc` below `kn_threshold` are treated as fully continuum
//! (wave-only, `DugksSolver` handles them exactly as in M1); cells at/above
//! the threshold spawn particles representing the *non-equilibrium residual*
//! of their distribution.
//!
//! For simplicity and strict conservation (the top priority per the spec's
//! "key correctness hazards"), this module implements the particle layer as
//! an explicit **local moment-conserving stochastic layer**: each rarefied
//! cell's mass/momentum/energy is (a) partly represented by explicit
//! simulation particles sampled from a local Maxwellian with the cell's
//! *current* macroscopic state, (b) freely transported for `dt`, (c)
//! stochastically collided (BGK relaxation applied as an analytic sub-step
//! per UGKWP, i.e. each particle's post-collision velocity is drawn from the
//! local equilibrium with probability `1 - exp(-dt/tau)`, otherwise kept
//! free-streaming — the standard DSMC/UGKWP no-time-counter-free formulation
//! of the same BGK relaxation used by the wave part), (d) re-binned to
//! moments. Exchange with the wave field is realized by having the wave
//! solver's own cell (rho, mom, E) *be* the target the particles are sampled
//! to reproduce and re-aggregated back into — i.e. particles carry a
//! *conservative* representation of a cell's moments for one step and hand
//! the (possibly redistributed, because of transport across cell faces)
//! moments back exactly, with no leakage, because every particle's weight
//! is tracked and summed exactly (floating-point-exact bookkeeping: the
//! total weight/momentum/energy removed from a cell of origin exactly
//! equals what is added to the destination cell(s) it moves into, since we
//! do the accounting from the particles themselves rather than from a
//! separately-integrated field).
