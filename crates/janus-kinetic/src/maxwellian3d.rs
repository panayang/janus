//! Full 3D-velocity-space Maxwellian equilibrium — single distribution
//! function `f(x, v, t)`, `v = (vx, vy, vz)`.
//!
//! ## Why the 2D-space (g,h) reduction is dropped here (not a shortcut)
//!
//! `janus_kinetic::maxwellian` (the 2D solver's module) integrates the true
//! 3D distribution `f(x, v, eta, t)` over a *discretized-out* third velocity
//! component `eta` analytically, producing the reduced pair `(g, h)`. That
//! reduction exists purely because a 2D *velocity-space* DVM (only `(vx,
//! vy)` discretized) is otherwise short one translational degree of freedom
//! for a monatomic gas: without it, the discrete equilibrium only carries
//! `D=2` DOF (giving the wrong `gamma=2` instead of the physical `5/3`), so
//! `h` is introduced as a bookkeeping device to carry the missing DOF's
//! energy without ever discretizing a third velocity axis (Xu & Huang 2010,
//! Chu 1965).
//!
//! For the M4 **3D** solver, physical space is 3D AND velocity space is
//! genuinely 3-component (`vx, vy, vz` are all discretized, see
//! `velocity_grid3d::VelocityGrid3D`). All 3 translational degrees of
//! freedom of a monatomic gas are therefore *already* directly represented
//! by the discrete velocity grid itself — there is nothing left to reduce
//! out, and no missing DOF to patch with an auxiliary `h`-like carrier.
//! Introducing a (g,h)-style reduction here would be redundant (it would
//! attempt to recover a DOF that the 3-component velocity grid already
//! supplies) and would incorrectly inflate the gas's effective heat
//! capacity. Consequently:
//!
//! - `DOF = 3` (all three components are *discretized*, `D_DISCRETE = 3`,
//!   `K_REDUCED = 0`), giving the correct monatomic `gamma = (3+2)/3 = 5/3`
//!   directly from the physical velocity moments, with no auxiliary
//!   distribution.
//! - The solver in `solver3d.rs` carries a single `Distribution3D::f` per
//!   cell (not an `(f,h)` pair), and every moment (mass, momentum, energy,
//!   heat flux) is computed directly from `f` and the 3-component velocity
//!   grid, exactly the way a *true*, non-reduced DVM computes them.
//!
//! This is a legitimate simplification relative to the 2D code — not a
//! shortcut or debt item — because the reduction it removes was itself only
//! ever a workaround for a velocity-space dimensionality deficit that does
//! not exist in 3D. No `// PHYSICS-DEBT:` marker is warranted for this
//! decision.
