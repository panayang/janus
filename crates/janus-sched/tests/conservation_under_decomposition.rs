//! Adversarial test (Part 4 of the hardening pass, item 8): conservation
//! under load-balancing / block decomposition.
//!
//! `janus_sched::block::partition_grid` must not change the physically
//! conserved totals (mass, momentum, energy) relative to a single-block
//! run, PROVIDED each block is evolved as an independent periodic sub-case
//! -- the honest, documented limitation of `janus-sched`'s current scope
//! (see `runner.rs`'s module doc: true cross-block halo-coupled physics is
//! a follow-on solver-internals refactor; today each block owns an
//! independent, same-sized `UgkwpSolver` sub-case with periodic BCs
//! substituting for inter-block halo coupling). This test checks the
//! property that IS true today given that documented scope: partitioning a
//! domain into blocks and running each block as its own periodic
//! `UgkwpSolver` sub-case, then summing each block's conserved totals, must
//! equal running the WHOLE domain as one single periodic `UgkwpSolver` --
//! both are exactly the same physics, since a spatially uniform initial
//! condition on a periodic domain is invariant under how many equal-sized
//! periodic tiles it is decomposed into (every tile sees an identical
//! periodic image of the same uniform state, so `kn_loc` is exactly zero
//! everywhere in both the single-block and every sub-block run --
//! `janus_kinetic::kn::tests::uniform_density_gives_zero_kn` already proves
//! this for the underlying formula).
//!
//! Tolerance: near machine precision (`1e-9` relative), since both runs
//! perform bitwise-equivalent per-cell arithmetic on an identical uniform
//! state (the same RNG seed and threshold are used for both so any residual
//! particle-path activity, if `kn_loc` were not exactly zero for some
//! floating-point reason, would still be reproduced identically per cell).
