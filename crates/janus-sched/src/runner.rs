//! dtact-backed per-block step runner.
//!
//! Each mesh block is advanced by spawning a dtact fiber for it every
//! timestep, with scheduling hints chosen from the block's last-measured
//! cost (particle count, per ENGINEERING_SPEC.md §7):
//!
//! - Wave-dominated blocks: `.kind(Compute).affinity(SameCCX).priority(Normal)`
//!   (deflectable — the default `CrossThreadFloat` switcher has
//!   `ALLOW_DEFLECTION = true`, so idle cores can steal this cheap, regular
//!   work).
//! - Particle-dominated blocks: `.kind(Compute).affinity(SameNUMA).priority(High)`
//!   to keep the heavier, more irregular working set NUMA-local.
//!
//! ## Halo exchange
//!
//! Because `UgkwpSolver::step` currently operates on the *whole* grid in one
//! call (the M1/M2 wave kernel and the M2 particle layer are both
//! whole-domain operations; see `janus_kinetic::coupled::UgkwpSolver`), a
//! true per-block-fiber decomposition would require splitting the DUGKS
//! flux kernel and the particle transport/relocation loops to operate on a
//! sub-rectangle plus a ghost halo copied from neighboring blocks — a
//! substantial solver-internals change. DESIGN: for M2, `janus-sched`
//! implements the halo-exchange *data structure* (double-buffered per-block
//! ghost copies) and the dtact fiber-per-block spawn/join pattern completely
//! (this is what the load-balance microbenchmark in
//! `examples/load_balance_bench.rs` exercises and measures), but the actual per-block
//! *physics* kernel invoked inside each fiber is a block-local copy-and-step
//! of a same-sized `UgkwpSolver` sub-case (each block owns an independent
//! solver instance sized to its own sub-rectangle, with periodic BCs
//! substituting for true inter-block halo coupling). This keeps the
//! fiber-parallel scheduling machinery fully real and measurable (which is
//! what the load-balance microbenchmark needs) while being honest that
//! full physical halo coupling between blocks of one shared `UgkwpSolver`
//! is a follow-on solver-internals refactor, not yet implemented here.
//! The `HaloBuffer` double-buffering machinery below is written against the
//! shape that refactor will need (per-edge ghost arrays, swap-not-copy
//! double buffering) so it is not throwaway code.
