//! dtact-backed per-3D-block step runner — direct 3D generalization of
//! `runner::SchedRunner` to `Block3D`/`Grid3D` (6 faces instead of 4 edges).
//!
//! Each mesh block is advanced by spawning a dtact fiber for it every
//! timestep, with scheduling hints chosen from the block's last-measured
//! cost (particle count, per ENGINEERING_SPEC.md §7):
//!
//! - Wave-dominated blocks: `.kind(Compute).affinity(SameCCX).priority(Normal)`
//!   (deflectable — the default `CrossThreadFloat` switcher has
//!   `ALLOW_DEFLECTION = true`, so idle cores can steal this cheap, regular
//!   work).
//! - Particle-dominated blocks: `.kind(Compute).affinity(SameNUMA).priority(High)`
//!   to keep the heavier, more irregular working set NUMA-local.
//!
//! ## Halo exchange (6 faces)
//!
//! Same design as the 2D `runner.rs`: `UgkwpSolver3D::step` currently
//! operates on the whole grid in one call, so a true per-block-fiber
//! decomposition would require splitting the DUGKS flux kernel and the
//! particle transport/relocation loops to operate on a sub-prism plus a
//! ghost halo copied from neighboring blocks across all 6 faces — a
//! substantial solver-internals change (identical situation to 2D, see
//! `runner.rs`'s module doc for the full rationale, which applies unchanged
//! here). `janus-sched` implements the halo-exchange *data structure*
//! (double-buffered per-block ghost copies, one per face: west/east/south/
//! north/down/up) and the dtact fiber-per-block spawn/join pattern
//! completely; the load-balance microbenchmark in
//! `examples/load_balance_bench_3d.rs` exercises and measures exactly this
//! scheduling machinery. The `HaloBuffer3D` double-buffering machinery below
//! is written against the shape the eventual full halo-coupling refactor
//! will need (per-face ghost arrays, swap-not-copy double buffering), not
//! throwaway code.
